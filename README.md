# cat_feeder
I made a simple automated cat feeder / food dispenser with Arduino Uno R3, some household materials and a crap load of hot glue.

The final product still has some problems, i.e. cat food get stuck in the water bottle and the box, often requires a few shakes for it to continue flowing. Still trying to figure out a better solution, meanwhile this one should serve my master fine.
